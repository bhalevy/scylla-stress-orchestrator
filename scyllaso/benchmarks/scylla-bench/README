Before you provision the environment, have a look at the the following file:

ec2-scylla/variables.tf

And modify the variables like the machine types etc.

To provision the environment, execute the following:

provision_terraform

The first time this script is called, it will create the following EC2 resources:
- security groups
- keypair
- the Scylla machine(s)
- Scylla monitor machine
- load generator machine(s).

The first step that needs to be done is to customize the properties.yml. It contains
the configuration for the number of items, duration, workload etc.

Before you run a benchmark, you need to load data in cluster. This is done using:

./load_data.py

Once the data has been loaded, a scylla-bench benchmark can be executed using:

./benchmark.py

After the benchmark completes, you can find the results in the following directory:

trials/dummy-benchmark/

You can run multiple benchmarks, e.g. perhaps changing the workload configuration.

After you are finished with running your benchmark, you can destroy the environment using:

unprovision_terraform

This will destroy all the created EC2 resources.
